# Diet Optimization using Linear Programming

This project implements a simple linear programming model to determine an optimal daily diet plan that meets specific nutritional requirements at minimal cost using the **PuLP** optimization library.

## Model Constraints
Calories: ≥ 2000 kcal

Protein: ≥ 50 grams

Fat: ≤ 70 grams

Calcium: ≥ 800 mg

## Objective

Minimize the total cost while meeting the above dietary constraints.

## Output
Displays:

The status of the optimization

Quantity of each food item to include

Total cost of the optimized meal plan

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PuLP library
